# DSA in C

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C. It aims to provide easy-to-understand and efficient code for different data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and searching algorithms. The purpose of this repository is to help learners and developers understand the core concepts of DSA and apply them effectively.

## Contents

The repository includes the following sections:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Includes algorithms like Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Linked List**: Single Linked List, Doubly Linked List operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations of Stack and Queue using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, etc.
- **Graphs**: Graph representation using adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
- **Hashing**: Hashing techniques and implementation.

## Getting Started

To use or contribute to this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You will need a C compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC.

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshshivhare23/DSA_in_C.git
```

### Running the Code

Each algorithm or data structure is implemented in separate `.c` files. You can compile and run them using the following commands:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
```
